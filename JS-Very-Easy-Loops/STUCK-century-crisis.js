// Task: 
// Scientists have discovered that in four decades, the world will EXPLODE! It will also take three decades to make a spaceship to travel to a new planet that can hold the entire world population.

// You must calculate the number of people there will be in three decades from now.

// The variable population is the world population now.
// Assume that every month, someone gives birth to more people n.
// Return the number of people there will be when the spaceship is complete.

// My Solution:

// PREP
// Parameters - 'population', 'n'
// Return - the number of people there will be in decasdes
// Examples - futurePeople(256, 2) ➞ 976; futurePeople(3248, 6) ➞ 5408
// Pseudocode - 

// Question: 

// Code

function futurePeople(population, n) {
	return (population + n(12))
}
